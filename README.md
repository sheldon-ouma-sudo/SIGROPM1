# SIGROP(Special Interest Groups and Poll  generator) Model

The objective of this project is to develop an automated system for detecting possible special interests groups of people with common interests and based on that  go to generating interest-based polls (questions and answers) on the things that might affect them on their daily lives  leveraging NLP models, with a dataset built through preprocessing and data collection using Wikipedia and OpenAI APIs limiting these two synthentic data sources for the project. This dataset will serve as the foundation for training, testing, and evaluation of the model.

The challenge is motivated from the industry perspective of a fast growing centralized polling platform that enable peer-based polling around specific interests. As the  platforms scales, there is a critical need to build a robust system that addresses key aspects such as scalability, monetization strategies, security, and enhancing user experience. This project aims to create a foundational model that supports these objectives, ensuring both the technical and user-facing elements are optimized for performance.

The project has two primary scopes. First, it focuses on generating special interest groupsâ€”cohorts of individuals united by common interests, such as a group of Miami Dolphins supporters. Second, it aims to generate diverse and contextually relevant polls tailored to the specific interests of these groups. These polls will span various domains such as culture, sports, and politics, allowing for engagement through personalized, meaningful questions that resonate with each group's particular focus.

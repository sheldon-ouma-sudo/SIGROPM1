# SIGROP-
special interest groups and poll  generator model. 

The objective of this project is to develop an automated system for detecting possible special interests groups of people with common interests and based on that  go to generating interest-based polls (questions and answers) on the things that might affect them on their daily lives  leveraging NLP models, with a dataset built through preprocessing and data collection using Wikipedia and OpenAI APIs limiting these to these two for the project. This dataset will serve as the foundation for training, testing, and evaluation of the model.
